    \item Residency is a famous housing complex with many well-established individuals among its residents. A recent survey conducted among the residents of the complex revealed that all of those residents who are well established in their respective fields happen to be academicians. The survey also revealed that most of these academicians are authors of some best-selling books.\\
    Based only on the information provided above, which one of the following statements can be logically inferred with certainty?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Some residents of the complex who are well established in their fields are also authors of some best-selling books
        \item All academicians residing in the complex are well established in their fields
        \item Some authors of best-selling books are residents of the complex who are well established in their fields
        \item Some academicians residing in the complex are well established in their fields.

    \item Ankita has to climb $5$ stairs starting at ground, while respecting the following rules:\\
    $1.$ At any stage, Ankita can move either one or two stairs up.\\
    $2.$ At any stage, Ankita cannot move to a lower step.\\
    Let $F\brak{N}$ denote the number of possible ways in which Ankita can reach the $N^{th}$ stair.For example,$F\brak{1}=1,F\brak{2}=2,F\brak{3}=3.$\\
    The value of $F\brak{5}$ is
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $8$
        \item $7$
        \item $6$
        \item $5$\\
    \end{enumerate}
   \item The information contained in DNA is used to synthesize proteins that are necessary for the functioning of life. DNA is composed of four nucleotides: Adenine $A$, Thymine $T$, Cytosine $C$, and Guanine $G$. The information contained in DNA can then be thought of as a sequence of these four nucleotides: $A$, $T$, $C$, and $G$. DNA has coding and non-coding regions. Coding regions—where the sequence of these nucleotides is read in groups of three to produce individual amino acids—constitute only about $2\%$ of human DNA. For example, the triplet of nucleotides CCG codes for the amino acid glycine, while the triplet GGA codes for the amino acid proline. Multiple amino acids are then assembled to form a protein.\\
    Based only on the information provided above, which of the following statements can be logically inferred with certainty?\\
    $\brak{i}$ The majority of human DNA has no role in the synthesis of proteins.\\
    $\brak{ii}$ The function of about $98\%$ of human DNA is not understood
